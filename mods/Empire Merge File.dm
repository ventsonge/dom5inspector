Originally based on dwarfen designs, the arbalests boast advanced sights which allow for impressive feats of accuracy. The Marksmen are not State Troops and lack the discipline and armour of State crossbowmen, but none can argue with their effectiveness at range. Marksmen dress in the black livery of Nuln and by tradition each displays their personal certification of marksmanship on their hip. Extensive training is required to gain this certificate and thus few forces field Marksmen in large numbers."

#name "Ironside"
#descr "In addition to fielding specially trained Marksmen to support the State Troops of the Empire, the Imperial Arsenal in Nuln has a permanent standing force dedicated its protection. This force is made up of hardened veterans and expert marksmen who are regularly drilled to ensure their cohesion and effectiveness. The Nuln Ironsides, as they are known, have mastered the combined use of the two traditional weapons of the Southern states, the halberd and the crossbow. Many a foe has closed to melee seeking to escape volley after volley of deadly accurate crossbow fire only to find themselves dashed on a wall of steel. The Ironsides are given the best equipment available to the Arsenal and are heavily armoured, though being neither noble nor in the direct service of an Elector Count they have no access to the finest dwarf-forged full plate of the Knightly Orders."

#descr "Halflings have lived in the Empire since the time of its founding, usually living a life of rustic peace and simplicity. They were granted the autonomous province of the Moot by Emperor Ludwig and the land has since become known as the breadbasket of the Empire. Small and plump, with a fondness for food and drink, they are not natural fighters but are excellent woodsmen and are extremely resistant to hostile magic. The Moot has no standing army but often contributes small contingents of colourfully uniformed gamekeepers, watchmen and militia to the armies of the Empire. Halflings are superb shots and can hunt for game to provide supplies for friendly troops."

#name "Wolf Kin"
#descr "The Wolf Kin are fighters driven to near-madness by hardship or despair. Rather than preaching punishment for man's sins and the coming of the end of the world, they take a more direct approach befitting their pragmatic and vengeful god, Ulric. Gathering together and clothing themselves in the furs of wolves, the Kin dedicate themselves to the service of Ulric and mete out punishment to Orcs, Beastmen, and other agents of destruction and evil. They fight with a cold, controlled fury, hacking down their foes with axe and sword and rarely taking a step back. Though eager to slay their enemies, the Wolf Kin understand when to stick to the shadows and are adept at guerilla warfare. Ulric grants his followers superior resistance to magic."

#name "Flagellant"
#descr "The Old World is a dangerous and often cruel place where war, plague and the vagaries of nature can destroy entire towns, turning their inhabitants into beggars, vagabonds and brigands. It is perhaps little wonder that some are driven to the brink of madness by their suffering and see their condition as a sign that they are living in the last days of a dying world. These crazed zealots often band together and latch onto salvation at the hands of Sigmar as their only hope, forming roving bands of Flagellants. These bands are compelled by a divine calling to hurl themselves into battle in a gesture of sacrifice and doom, showing no fear, pain or mercy. No Sigmarite could fail to recognise the pure unfettered faith in the eyes of these madmen and though they are avoided when possible, they are considered sacred."

The nature of their mission means Hunters' equipment is often worn from travel and lacking the services of blacksmiths, they often discard pieces of armour damaged in skirmishes. Lances need to be replaced too often and swords become dull and rusted, so the Hunters prefer to use heavier and more reliable axes."

They are an elite within an elite who form the personal bodyguard of the Grand Master and are a powerful force on the battlefield. A recently founded Order, the Hunters of Sigmar emerged after the Storm of Chaos, pledging to track and destroy Chaos raiders left behind following the invasion. Typically operating in small groups to track Beastmen Warbands, the Hunters are expert woodsmen and can always rely on the support of the populace who appreciate such mighty warriors stooping to defend even the smallest villages. The nature of their mission means Hunters' equipment is often worn from travel and lacking the services of blacksmiths, they often discard pieces of armour damaged in skirmishes. Lances need to be replaced too often and swords become dull and rusted, so the Hunters prefer to use heavier and more reliable axes."

He carries two heirlooms of the Gold College; the Amulet of Sea gold, which protects against hostile magic, and the Cloak of Molten Metal, which protects against missile fire and creates illusionary copies of the mage. As Supreme Patriarch he also wields the Staff of Volans, an ancient and powerful artifact that boosts his already superb magical abilities and allows him to generate magic gems. The rulers of Nuln recently gifted Gelt a pegasus on which he soars over the battlefield, turning the tide with his spells."

Though their goals are rather different the University works closely with the Imperial School of Engineers and at times even the Bright, Grey and Gold Colleges. The University is closely monitored by both the Colleges of Magic and the Sigmarite Faith, for many is the bright young scholar or frustrated academic who has in the past pursued knowledge not meant for mortals and strayed into the world of dark arcana or heresy. Consequently Scholars of Altdorf are more restricted in their studies than those of the University of Nuln. Scholars are neither Wizards nor Engineers, but their knowledge of chemistry, mathematics and philosophy makes them excellent researchers. Scholars have traditionally always flourished in slothful, decadent societies."

#name "Scholar"
#descr "The University of Nuln is the largest of its kind in the known world and certainly the Empire; a place of learning set apart from the secretive Colleges of Magic or the tightly controlled Sigmarite faith. Here the mysteries of the world are unravelled and new theories and technologies devised, some of which are taken up with gusto by the Engineers of the Imperial Arsenal. The University of Nuln has a long standing rivalry with that of Altdorf and in recent years have extricated itself further from the grip of Sigmarite dogma. This has sparked talk of possible heresy within the walls of the institution, but Countess Emmanuelle von Liebwitz of Nuln has rebuffed all Sigmarite probes in this matter as a threat to her authority. Scholars are neither Wizards nor Engineers, but their knowledge of chemistry, mathematics and philosophy makes them excellent researchers. Scholars have traditionally always flourished in slothful, decadent societies."

The advance of these metal behemoths is terrifying to behold, as arrows ricochet from their hulls and blades shatter against their armour. The Imperial Arsenal at Nuln has only a handful of Steam Tanks operational at any given time, for these are complex and unreliable creations. The furnace and boiler at the heart of the tank produce an incredible heat which radiates to the surrounding area and as such the Tank is dangerous to friend and foe alike. If the Steam Tank becomes sufficiently damaged the engineer in charge will switch from simply rolling over the foe to venting great jets of super-heated steam.

With near half the Order lost fighting a Chaos warband and a prominent patron successfully tried for heresy, the Order faced financial ruin. So it was that the young Knight Juergen Fruehauf was appointed to the position of Grandmaster. While a capable leader and proud knight, the true reason for Juergens appointment was the Fruehaufs extremely profitable holdings in Marienburg. Even so, three years into his rule the energetic Grandmaster has revitalised the Gold Lion and is on his way to earning the respect of more established Orders. Juergen has an ostentatious streak and has purchased a trained lion from the Imperial Bestiary which accompanies him in battle."

With near half the Order lost fighting a Chaos warband and a prominent patron successfully tried for heresy, the Order faced financial ruin. So it was that the young Knight Juergen Fruehauf was appointed to the position of Grandmaster. While a capable leader and proud knight, the true reason for Juergens appointment was the Fruehaufs extremely profitable holdings in Marienburg. Even so, three years into his rule the energetic Grandmaster has revitalised the Gold Lion and is on his way to earning the respect of more established Orders. Juergen has an ostentatious streak and has purchased a trained lion from the Imperial Bestiary which accompanies him in battle."

Gold Wizards often bear traces of their experiments in alchemy and transmutation, chemical stains and scorch marks, but also garb of fine quality and a great deal of jewellery. Able to exert power over metal, the Gold order make powerful battlemages and away from the field of battle are experts in forging magical items, though not near so skilled as the Dwarfs.

The wind of Hysh is the purest amongst the Lores, though it is also the most effusive and difficult to master. Because of this, comparatively few Light Wizards ever earn the title of Wizard Lord. Those that do are true masters of the arcane who have begun to understand the nature of magic itself and can bend Light energy itself to reproduce facets of the other Lores.

Honouring an Order with a memorial to their fallen is an expensive act, but it will result in a group of Inner Circle Knights and perhaps even the Grandmaster of the Order pledging to serve your cause. The White Wolves are one of the oldest and most powerful Orders in the Old World and are dedicated to the defence of Middenheim. White Wolves are offensively minded and are armed with great two handed middenhammers which let them smash aside their foes."

---- Tribute to the Knights Panther

#newmonster 7536

#name "Tribute to the Knights Panther"
#descr "The knightly Orders of the Empire are an elite capable of crushing almost any foe in battle. As powerful as they are though, they are equally independant, despite countless attempts by the State or Church to try and reign them in. 
Honouring an Order with a memorial to their fallen is an expensive act, but it will result in a group of Inner Circle Knights and perhaps even the Grandmaster of the Order pledging to serve your cause. The Kights Panther are one of the largest and certainly one of the most famous Orders in the Old World. They are dedicated to eradicating Chaos in all forms and are trained to fight even in the Chaos Wastes themselves. With the exotic panther as their symbol, curved foreign swords to back up their lances and steeds interbred with the famed Arabian breeds, they are a unique but highly effective Order."

The Order holds a great deal of political clout in the South of the Empire and are generally free to choose which campaigns they take part in, usually picking those which guarantee the most glory with the least dirty work. Knights Encarmine are unusual in that they have entirely abandoned the traditional lance and shield, instead perfecting a secret technique allowing them to wield two swords from horseback. Though their Order is rather hard to work with at times, the Knights Encarmine are perhaps the most technically skilled in the Empire."

Encased in black steel and armed with sacred silver scythes they patrol the fell roads of Stirland, ever watchful for incursions from neighbouring Sylvania. The Scythes are ever watchful and though despised by the common folk, maintain a network of spies to better root out hidden foes."

A recently founded Order, the Hunters of Sigmar emerged after the Storm of Chaos, pledging to track and destroy Chaos raiders left behind following the invasion. Typically operating in small groups to track Beastmen Warbands, the Hunters are expert woodsmen and can always rely on the support of the populace who appreciate such mighty warriors stooping to defend even the smallest villages. The nature of their mission means Hunters' equipment is often worn from travel and lacking the services of blacksmiths, they often discard pieces of armour damaged in skirmishes. Lances need to be replaced too often and swords become dull and rusted, so the Hunters prefer to use heavier and more reliable axes."

--------- EVENTS

--the idea here is to write an event for each knightly order which kills off their specific tribute unit and summons the knightly order.
--event one triggers when you have tribute unit X. It kills tribute unit X and summons the order X - GM and their IC. This may require two events chained together. It establishes event code Y. This event can only happen once.
--event two triggers when you have tribute unit X and event code Y. It summons a smaller number of the IC of order X.

--This requires that each nation has a tribute unit for each order they want to be able to buy.

--so it turned out that using event codes is bad and didn't work properly because you can only have one code per province at a time. Instead I tried various things, but the firstshape stuff I tried somehow screwed with event triggering and com killing.

--so in the end I basically have two events with the same trigger requirements. But because they kill the requirement, only one can trigger. It seems that it's 50/50 which triggers.

#brief "The Empire is the largest and most powerful of the lands of men in the Old World, a mighty nation that stands as the bulwark against the many enemies of man. It is a land where magic, invention and the courage of mortal men rub shoulders, each an essential weapon in the war against the malign powers in the Warhammer world."

#descr "The Empire is the largest and most powerful of the lands of men in the Old World, a mighty nation that stands as the bulwark against the many enemies of man. It is a land where magic, invention and the courage of mortal men rub shoulders, each an essential weapon in the war against the malign powers in the Warhammer world. The men of the Empire have none of the supernatural strength nor brutal upbringing of the Warriors of Chaos, nor do they boast the numberless ranks of the vile Skaven, the savage resilience of the green-skinned Orcs or uncanny agility of the High Elves. Rather, the men of the Empire rely upon their steel-forged armour, the devices of war made at the Academy of Nuln and their unflinching faith in their warrior god, Sigmar. Middenheim is known as the City of the White Wolf, home of the Cult of Ulric and bulwark against Chaos."
#summary "Race: Humans.
Military: Medium and heavy infantry with extremely heavy cavalry and dedicated missile units.
Magic: Colleges allow access to all non blood magic but their taxes make labs more expensive.
Priests: Strong."
