The Void Lord is an otherworldly being that spawned in the Void. It was worshiped on that strange and distant star from which the great race of R'lyeh came and now the Starspawns have summoned it to this world. As a Lord of the Void, this being has great power in the world of magic. In the physical world, however, the Void Lord is blind and orients itself with powers of mind and magic.
