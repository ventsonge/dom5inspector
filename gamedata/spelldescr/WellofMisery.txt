This mighty ritual is a blessing to units across the world. Diseases, old age, suffering and pains are all drained of some of their essence. All malign energies are siphoned from the world and concentrated in the Well of Misery, effectively giving the caster a huge income of magical gems of Death. Each month 21 death gems are generated. Tax revenue is also slightly increased in all provinces of the world.
