All forests under neutral or enemy dominion act as if they were temples of the caster's pretender. When the dominion has become friendly it stops spreading. Forests with friendly dominion will spontaneously spawn attacks from forest beings in the province or its neighbors if controlled by an enemy. A strong dominion or high Growth scale helps the effectiveness of the attacks and Wastelands are never attacked by the forest creatures.
