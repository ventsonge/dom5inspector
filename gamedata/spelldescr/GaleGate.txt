The caster opens a rift in space creating a gate into a realm of storms. Huge amounts of aerial magic are effectively channeled through this gate, producing twenty Air gems each turn. Not all of the powers of the Gale Gate can be harnessed though. Hurricanes and storms will be randomly unleashed upon provinces not controlled by the caster.
