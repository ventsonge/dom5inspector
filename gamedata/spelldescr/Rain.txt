This spell creates a heavy rain upon the battlefield. This makes it harder to fly and the heat effects of Abysians and other hot creatures are severely reduced. Fire magic is more difficult to use during heavy rain, as all non-underwater If it is cold it will snow instead. Snow does not increase the fatigue for fire spells, but it does reduce some heat effects although less so than rain.
