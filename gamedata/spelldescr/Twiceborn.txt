With this ritual, the necromancer enchants his own body to protect himself from death. If the necromancer is slain, he is revived as a Wight Mage in the province where the ritual was cast, possibly gaining dark insights in the process. For the ritual to work, the province it was cast in must be in friendly hands when the necromancer dies. This spell does not work on undead, demons or inanimates.
